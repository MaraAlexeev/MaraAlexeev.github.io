<h1>HMB (Hold my baby…)</h1>
<p>This is my first attempt at quick plot beautification. “Hold my beer” is a punchline (or lead up) to many a joke in the US with often a picture or graphic at the end of the joke to demonstrate without words what happened. I don’t like beer, but I do have a baby that demands me very frequently. This is an attempt of my self care for my brain during these early months.</p>

<h2>Car Colors</h2>
<p>My husband showed me a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/j7yfqb/oc_car_color_distribution_broken_down_by/">graphic of car colors</a> over time that I thought was fun, but I also thought I could make it prettier.</p>
<p>A quick Google source lead me here to see the post he had shown me and here is where I grabbed the <a href="https://pastebin.com/1gb8vAAr">OP’s data</a>.</p>
