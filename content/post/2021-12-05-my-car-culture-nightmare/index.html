<h1>Big parenting fears</h1>
<p>One of my biggest fears as a parent is the threat of cars to the well-being of my children. And unlike other lurking parenting fears, this one is upsetting because it is a fairly rational fear based on the causes of death and injury to children in and out of vehicles.</p>
