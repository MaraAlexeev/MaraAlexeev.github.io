<p>This is my first post on my new website built with the R package blogdown, the help of many online help pages, and my lovely husband. I am using Github and Netlify as well. I don’t have the energy to write a post about how I built this, but here is the list of things that caused pain:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>in my config.toml file I had replaced the baseurl default of <code>baseurl = "/"</code> with <code>baseurl = "https://www.maraalexeev.com"</code></p></li>
<li><p>this causes problems so just keep it as the /</p></li>
<li><p>on Netlify there is a deploy setting that I did incorrectly so my page worked locally but not online</p></li>
<li><p>Answer <a href="https://community.netlify.com/t/common-issue-i-ve-deployed-my-site-but-i-still-see-page-not-found/125/2">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>somehow I got a post on my page from 1 AD (suspect no date was included on something), I renamed my file from a <code>foo.Rmarkdown</code> to <code>foo.Rmd</code> and the problem went away, but I can’t be certain that I didn’t also do something else in my quest.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Overall, this was an amazing but slightly frustrating experience with most of the frustration being at the deployment phase. Now that I have site up and running, I am beyond excited to start doing more with it. I especially am excited about figuring out how to have my data easily accessible for someone re-running my analysis in something that I post.</p>
<p>A few quick things that I hope to do soon are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Understand more of what an R project means and how to use it in my workflow</li>
<li>Figure out how to store files and content in a reasonable method</li>
<li>Get amazing at Rmarkdown</li>
</ol>
