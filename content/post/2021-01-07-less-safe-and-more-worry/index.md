# Clinical Thinking is Hard

It's hard to make decisions. It's really hard to make good decisions. Sometimes I'm not even sure what good means. And it certainly means different things to different people during a clinical encounter. 

I have said for years, but don't think I have written down one of my little phrases I think about a lot in pediatrics:

> Sometimes "better safe than sorry" is less safe and more worry.

> *â€” Mara in clinic, almost every time, in her head.*
