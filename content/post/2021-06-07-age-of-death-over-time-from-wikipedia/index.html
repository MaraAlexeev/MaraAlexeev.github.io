<p>So last summer (it’s been a busy year) my husband showed me a tweet and challenged me to make some cool graphs.</p>
<p>The inciting posts were these:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
Of people with Wikipedia articles, average age at death of people who died in a given year.<br><br>[Slightly smoothed; incomplete dataset (~50k deaths); only including deaths age &gt;= 20. I previously tweeted a version with x = year of birth, but decline in recent cohorts was confusing.] <a href="https://t.co/kGCsmz58na">pic.twitter.com/kGCsmz58na</a>
