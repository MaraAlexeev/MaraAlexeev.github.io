I saw a tweet today that inspired me to put my newfound skills in flexdashboard to use. I might be biting off too much to chew but isn't that always the case!!

Here's the [inspirational tweet](https://twitter.com/meghanbkelly/status/1293525325339656195):

A few things that I want to think about and do for this.
- I want to create a very simple flexdashboard
- I want to figure out how to display the flexdashboard on my blog 
- I want to learn a few simple things about a maps package to put on the flexdashboard and hopefully be able to allow for a viewer to hover over the county and see the name and specific details about the county
- Learn how to embed tweets directly on the blog

# Flexdashboard

I would like to take some of the data released by the state of Massachusetts from this past week to create a flexdashboard that tells you about the number of new cases, displays a map with some hover over text/additional information present, and has a gauge that is red/yellow/green based on what the state thinks is the overall status of cases are for the week.

# Displaying dashboard 

Due to how blogdown works, having a flexdashboard as a post on the blog doesn't seem to work, but it seems possible to link to the Rmarkdown document that will appropriately render.

# Embeding tweets

I wanted to directly embed the journalist's tweets on the website. I found some online advice on this and it crashed my site! I did a work around by just putting in a link and then a screenshot of the tweet, but that seems a bit lame. I want to dig a bit deeper to see what the clever way is to do so.
