<h1>Tomorrow</h1>
<p>Tomorrow is my first day as the chief pediatric resident at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in NYC. I have lots of goals for the year, but knowing how chaotic life is in the hospital, I wanted to make sure I wrote them down before they are forgotten! I often find the workflow in hospitals is so busy that it is often to just hard enough to survive the day without building the foundation to try to have more <em>good</em> days.</p>
<p>There is tons of material already available to me, so I will need to careful review those to see what just needs to be updated before I know what I need to make myself.</p>
<p>As the year passes I hope to update each of the these bullet points to show my progress.</p>
