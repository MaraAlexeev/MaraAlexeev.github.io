My name is Mara Alexeev. I currently live in New York City, but I grew up on a farm in central Iowa. In fourth grade I was in love with space and wanted to be a part time astronaut and part time farmer. While those dreams have not yet been realized, I have completed a combined pediatrics residency and masters of public health at Oakland Kaiser Permanente and at UC Berkeley in May 2016, respectively. 

Currently, I am applying to fellowships in Clinical Informatics with a hopeful start Summer 2020. Wish me luck!

I love learning human and computer languages. I’ve had a long love affair with Russian and German, and recently became interested in American Sign Language (and also the Russian Manual Alphabet!) and thinking about learning Norwegian. On the computer front, I’m learning R and specifically enjoy data visualization and open and reproducible analysis and research.
