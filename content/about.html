<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>My name is Mara Alexeev. I currently live in Brookline, Massachusetts, but I grew up on a farm in central Iowa. In fourth grade I was in love with space and wanted to be a part time astronaut and part time farmer.</p>
<p>Currently, I am the doing a fellowship in Clinical Informatics at Boston Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p>I love learning human and computer languages. I’ve had a long love affair with Russian and German, and recently became interested in American Sign Language (and also the Russian Manual Alphabet!) and thinking about learning Norwegian. On the computer front, I’m learning R and specifically enjoy data visualization and open and reproducible analysis and research.</p>
