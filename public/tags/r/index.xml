      <description>I’m in love with some new dplyr functions: if_any() and if_all.
Read all about it here.
Below I’ll share the problem I solved using one of these new functions.
library(tidyverse)library(googlesheets4)library(kableExtra)data &amp;lt;- googlesheets4::read_sheet(&amp;quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgPQTyVhV3tlrfo-Luw-fxBWLQ_LtQp9s5IV-1_9qMo/edit?usp=sharing&amp;quot;, sheet = &amp;quot;Sheet1&amp;quot;)Here’s the set up for the problem and solution. Imagine you are looking at unique encounter visits for patients and the associated diagnosis codes. You get a spreadsheet that has an id column followed by columns of diagnosis codes.</description>

      <title>Creating a new cv with R!</title>

      <description>Because I hate reformating my CV I was searching online on writing CV&amp;rsquo;s with R. I found a great package datadrivencv that has a great template to create a CV from a spreadsheet that keeps your career information tidy and in one place, and allows you to use the same source to create different versions of a CV from minor modifications.
Another side benefit of this, is it encourages you to store you career info in one place instead of just scattered about!</description>

      <title>Recipe storage</title>

      <description>For several years I have been thinking about what is the best way to store recipes for my purposes. Currently, I have a mixture of ways that serve me quite well. I send myself emails about recipes, I have some Google docs, I have sticky notes in my very few, beloved cookbooks, and I have my absolute standards on 3x5 note cards that live in a designated spot in the kitchen.</description>

      <description>The following is from year ago exactly: 2020-04-05. I am digging up old work and putting it on my new website. This was some of my very first independent work. Looking back at it now, it is painful to see how messy my work was. But I love reading my little comments because it reminds me how excited I would get when something would work! I saw a comment about feeling intimidated by StackOverflow.</description>
