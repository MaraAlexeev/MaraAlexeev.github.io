      <description>For several years I have been thinking about what is the best way to store recipes for my purposes. Currently, I have a mixture of ways that serve me quite well. I send myself emails about recipes, I have some Google docs, I have sticky notes in my very few, beloved cookbooks, and I have my absolute standards on 3x5 note cards that live in a designated spot in the kitchen.</description>

      <description>The following is from year ago exactly: 2020-04-05. I am digging up old work and putting it on my new website. This was some of my very first independent work. Looking back at it now, it is painful to see how messy my work was. But I love reading my little comments because it reminds me how excited I would get when something would work! I saw a comment about feeling intimidated by StackOverflow.</description>
