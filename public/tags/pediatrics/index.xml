      <description>TomorrowTomorrow is my first day as the chief pediatric resident at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in NYC. I have lots of goals for the year, but knowing how chaotic life is in the hospital, I wanted to make sure I wrote them down before they are forgotten! I often find the workflow in hospitals is so busy that it is often to just hard enough to survive the day without building the foundation to try to have more good days.</description>
