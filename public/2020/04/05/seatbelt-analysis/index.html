<p>The following is from year ago exactly: 2020-04-05. I am digging up old work and putting it on my new website. This was some of my very first independent work. Looking back at it now, it is painful to see how messy my work was. But I love reading my little comments because it reminds me how excited I would get when something would work! I saw a comment about feeling intimidated by StackOverflow. I followed the link and didn’t see anything too interesting/sippy, so I wonder if a comment was taken away. (I feel like I remember someone telling the OP not to say “Thank you” in their post.) Or if things that were intimidating a year ago don’t seem to even break the surface anymore. Sadly, I think it is that the post was modified after I linked to it.</p>
<div id="do-all-germans-wear-their-seatbelts" class="section level1">
<h1>Do all Germans wear their seatbelts?</h1>
<p>Inspired by this Tweet:
<a href="https://twitter.com/hspter/status/1134098154167496704" class="uri">https://twitter.com/hspter/status/1134098154167496704</a></p>
<p>I laughed, but I did not think that this was possible. I imagined it was just playing into my acknowledged stereotype that Germany and Switzerland are impressively rule following and have a special relationship with their vehicles.</p>
<p>Did a quick Google search: rates of seat belt use Germany.</p>
<p>Found this: <a href="https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2013/country_profiles/germany.pdf?ua=1" class="uri">https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2013/country_profiles/germany.pdf?ua=1</a></p>
<p>So a quick scan of the datasheet says that 98% of people in the front seat use seat belts. Seems pretty great, but then I wanted to know how it all compares.</p>
<p>So I decided to do a #чистый_четвер! (That’s a clean Thursday in Russian as a play off of #TidyTuesday)</p>
<p>My libraries:</p>

<p>Grab the JSON from the WHO site:
(My first time getting a JSON independently!!!!)</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>fromJSON(txt, simplifyVector = TRUE,
simplifyDataFrame = simplifyVector, simplifyMatrix = simplifyVector,

<pre class="r"><code>seatbelt_who &lt;- fromJSON(&quot;https://apps.who.int/gho/athena/data/GHO/RS_212.json?filter=COUNTRY:*;SEATTYPE:*&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Take a peak to make sure I imported correctly. (Note I set this following code chuck to eval = FALSE because the output was pages and pages long.)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(seatbelt_who)</code></pre>
<p>Goodness that looks crazy. Seems like there are nested datasets. I’ll try the the simplifed Json to see if I can get started faster.</p>

<p>Very confused because when I look at the dataframe it seems to have many columns but only these list and then the data are described as having 3 variables. I think I am missing something about how the data are organized. Gonna try to clean some of it up with janitor.</p>

<p>Great. Names look better. But everything looks like a chr. I am going to coerece some cols.

I fell down a rabbit hole. I read some stuff on stackoverflow
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22772279/converting-multiple-columns-from-character-to-numeric-format-in-r" class="uri">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22772279/converting-multiple-columns-from-character-to-numeric-format-in-r</a></p>
<p>But also as totally unrelated to this analysis commentary. I like stackoverflow but I get anxious reading the comments sometime. The comments can be sooo snippy: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53857448/11484875" class="uri">https://stackoverflow.com/a/53857448/11484875</a> . Doesn’t seem very welcoming and I don’t have the confidence to post there, yet.
I am so thankful for everyone that does though!</p>
<p>Ok back to analysis</p>
<p>This looks promising:
df %&gt;% mutate_at(‘x1’,as.numeric) %&gt;% str()</p>
<p>Also lots about lapply</p>
<p>data[] &lt;- lapply(data, function(x) type.convert(as.character(x), as.is = TRUE)) #change all vars to their best fitting data type</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lapply(seatbelt_1, class)</code></pre>

<p>Nope</p>
<p>Try again

<p>Looks like that worked!!!</p>
<p>Okay these seems great. I don’t quite understand some of the piping behavior, but moving forward!!!</p>
<p>Time to plot!!!
Lets look at counties in europe. still a lot, so just front seat rates and then exclude ones with NA</p>
<pre class="r"><code>europe_seatbelt &lt;-  filter(seatbelt_convert_2, dim_region==&quot;Europe&quot;)

europe_seatbelt_front &lt;- filter(europe_seatbelt, dim_seattype ==&quot;Front seat&quot;)

europe_seatbelt_final &lt;- filter(europe_seatbelt_front,  !is.na(value))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>europe_graph &lt;- ggplot(europe_seatbelt_final) + aes(x = reorder(dim_country, value)) + aes(y = value) + geom_point()

europe_graph</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-04-05-seatbelt-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" />
I am so pleased!! I did not know about reorder until now!!!! I knew it must exist but hadn’t used it!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titles &lt;- labs(title = &quot;Who has their seatbelt on in Europe? (2013)&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Exploring seatbelt use after falling into a Tweethole by @MaraAlexeev&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;Front Seatbelt Use % -- Red line is 95%&quot;, caption = &quot;Data from WHO&quot;)

europe_graph + titles</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-04-05-seatbelt-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Ok to fix the country names and add color</p>
<pre class="r"><code>europe_graph + titles + coord_flip() + scale_color_gradient() +
 theme_classic() + geom_hline(yintercept=95, linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(position = &quot;right&quot;) + scale_x_discrete(position = &quot;top&quot;) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-04-05-seatbelt-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="672" />
Omg. The plotted data look like a buckled seat belt!!!!!!!!</p>
